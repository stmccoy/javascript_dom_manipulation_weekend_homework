My first attempt at dom manipilation using vanilla JS. The app itself is a todo list app, which allows the user to create, read and delete their tasks. I was really happy with how this app turned out. Managed to get most of it to work without many bugs. The only thing I struggled to do was keep the delete buttons of the tasks at the bottom of the divs. This is only a problem when two tasks next to each other have different text lengths. The div stretches to match the length of the largest text on a row, however the button doesn't follow it so the shorter text ends up with a button half way up the div. I found a solution that required absolute positioning in the CSS, however I wasn't full happy with this so I left it out of the end product. 

The whole thing is just html, css and javascript so should be viewable by simply opening the html, whilst ensuing the javascript and css files are in locations where the html can find them.
