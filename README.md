My first attempt at dom manipilation using vanilla JS. The app itself is a todo list app, which allows the user to create, read and delete their tasks. There is no data persistence but all the front end functions work as expected. The only bit I struggled to figure out was how to keep the delete buttons of the tasks at the bottom of their respective divs. This was only a problem when two tasks next to each other had different text lengths. The divs all stretch to match the length of the largest text block on their row, however the delete button is positioned relative to the text contained in the div, rather than the div length, so the shorter texts end up with their button's half way up their div when they have a longer piece of text on the same row as them. I found a solution that required absolute positioning in the CSS, however I wasn't fully happy with the result so I left it out of the end product. This was simply a todo list app so the amounts of texts required to cause the bug weren't really necessary for single sentence reminders. However I appreciate that in production the users can't always be trusted to think so logically, so this would need to be refactored.

The whole thing is just html, css and javascript so should be viewable by simply opening the html, whilst ensuing the javascript and css files are in locations where they can be found.
